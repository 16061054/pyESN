# Using an Echo State Network to learn a dynamical system

This is a simplified Python implementation of Herbert Jaeger's Echo State
Network [learning to be a frequency generator](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_state_network)
controlled by an external signal. Echo State Networks are easy to train recurrent neural networks.

This is not a tutorial on ESNs, but there are some colorful plots at the end.

It's an Ipython notebook file - [view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cluclu/pyESN/blob/master/ESN_freqgen.ipynb).
